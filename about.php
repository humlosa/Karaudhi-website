          Cancer is an abnormal growth of cells which divide irrepressibly by deviating the usual rules of the cell division. Normal cells obey the signals which direct them to undergo division and differentiation into new cells or decease. Cancerous cells advance to become independent from these signals and result to grow and proliferate relentlessly. Cancer disease involves several tempo-spatial deviations in the physiology of cells leading to precancerous (premalignant) or cancerous (malignant) state.</p>
          <br>
        <p><u>Causes of cancer </u><br />
          Cancer is a complex group of diseases with many possible causes. Common ones include:<br />
          (i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chemical carcinogens<br />
          (ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lifestyle factors (smoking, drinking etc.)<br />
          (iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lack of exercise<br />
          (iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unhealthy eating<br />
          (v)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Infection<br />
          (vi)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; genetic makeup<br />
          Most cancers are probably due to a combination of factors. Not everybody who has contact with a potential cancer-causing substance (carcinogen) or has an unhealthy lifestyle will develop cancer.</p>
        <p><br />
          <u>Problem In Available Medicines and Treatment</u><br />
          The recent cancer treatments result in many side effects of the above therapies are risks of infection, anaemia (low red blood cells), bruising and bleeding, hair loss, tiredness (fatigue), sour mouth and ulcers, feeling sick (nausea) or being sick (vomiting), loss of appetite, taste changes, constipation, diarrhoea, skin color changes, and hormonal changes.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><u>Possible remedy </u><br />
          The development and research into naturally derived compounds to be used for anticancer treatment is becoming high in demand with a focus on those derived from plant species and their natural products, chemopreventive measures are needed not only to prevent but cure cancers at lower stages.</p>
          <br>
        <p align="justify"><u>KARAUDHI: DATABASE FOR ANTICANCER PLANTS </u><br />
          Despite presence of voluminous biomedical literature in PubMed that provides evidence for variety of naturally occurring compounds demonstrating anti-neoplastic activity, to my knowledge, no comprehensive resource exists that focuses on plant-based naturally occurring compounds with anti-cancerous activity, although a few natural compound databases like CANCERES and PHI for Targets or cancerous compound&ndash;target repository like CancerResource have been published. Therefore, to complement these databases and to capture the intrinsic features of natural compounds that exhibit anti-tumour properties, KARAUDHI database is being designed and developed a central resource termed Naturally Occurring Plant-based Anti-cancer Compound-Activity- database.</p>
        <p>The data used here summarizes the latest research in cancer chemoprevention and treatment using the bioactive components from natural plants. Relevant chemical formulations involved in the pharmacological effects of these phytochemicals are discussed. Further which are wished to expand this research area not only for their scientific soundness, but also for their potential druggability.</p>
